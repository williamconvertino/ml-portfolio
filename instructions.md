I have a basic Nextjs tsx website. I want to create a portfolio website. Here are some specifications:

# Website Layout Overview

The website should be a simple, clean, and professional looking portfolio site. It is meant to be shown to machine learning recruiters and should prioritize ease of use for hiring managers. It should be designed mainly with desktop viewing in mind, but still work well for mobile.

The website should be largely in a single page and you should be able to scroll down to see the different sections. The first section is an "about me" blurb. The next sections should be the main content sections. The last section should contain my contact information and relevant social media links.

The content sections will have section titles, like "work experience", "publications", etc. Each section will have some number of cards containing an image, title, a brief description of the specific item, and any relevant links.

There should be a navigation bar that allows users to jump to different sections of the main scroll.

# Navigation Bar

My name should be left justified in the nav bar. It should stand out, whether that be through making it large, increasing the weight, or another method.

Right justified on the nav bar should be the buttons for navigating to each section.

The nav bar should be the same color as the background, but highlighting the buttons should make them turn slightly darker for increased visibility.

# About Me Blurb

At the top of the home page should be the "about me" section. It should have an image of me on the left and a short blurb on the right.

# Content Sections

Each content section should have a centered title followed by a list of cards. Each card should have a small image on the left, a title, and a description of the project. At the bottom of the card should be any relevant links, each with a corresponding icon.

# Contact Section

This section should contain any social media links, my phone number, and my email.

# Style

I want the website to have a light theme. The background color should be an off-white and the text should be a dark gray or off-black color. Specifically find color pairings and font choices that are known to work well together.

It should look minimal, clean, and sleek. I don't want any components to look amateur. For any buttons, make sure they have some professional looking hover effects. For the scrolling, make sure it looks professional and smooth. Take a lot of care in the CSS/styling of each component. Use libraries when necessary to achieve a professional look.

# Packages

Only use tailwind, heroicons, react-scroll, and mui. You may also install any fonts or image libraries needed.

# Versions

Make sure to stay consistent with any React, Nextjs, or Tailwind versions that are already in the project. You may be unfamiliar with the current versions (as they may be beyond your training cutoff), but use the existing files as reference.
